# AlgTeacher v0.1
AlgTeacher is a (WIP) tool that helps you learn Rubik's cube algorithms.

## How does it work?
You add algorithm for cases you want to learn to the app.  
You can add a description and a picture of the case.  
Whenever you want to test yourself, you choose one of them and the app asks you if you remember the algorithm that solves the case.  
If you do, you press "Yes". If you don't, you press "No", and the app shows you the solution.

You can also long-press cases to edit or delete them.


## What is planned for the future?

* **Displaying scrambles:** The app will display a scramble to the algorithm that lets you get the cube into position, so you can check if you remember the algorithm without remembering the notation itself.
* **Sorting by priority:** The app will display cases you might have forgotten near the top, according to how many times you forgot the case in the recent days.
* **Importing algorithms from databases:** Writing algorithms by hand is not fun, and copy-pasting on the phone is also not that fun. The app will allow you to import algorithm sets (such as PLL or OLL) with one click.
